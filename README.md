# Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension
ðŸŽ¯ Personal dashboard Chrome extension built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript built while learning to work with APIs in JavaScript through the Frontend Developer Bootcamp on Scrimba. This project is a combination of code-along and building considerable chunks of the app on my own through challenges set by the course teacher.
